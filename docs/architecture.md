## Project overview

Bugs we can find:

* Crash during the execution (segfault, etc)
* Mismatching results in PHP and KPHP
* Invalid/unset error location (especially for KPHP)

Bugs we might find in the future:

* Memory leaks
* Unexpectedly high execution times

## Architecture overview

Core packages:

* `ir` describes intermediate representation and its type system
* `irgen` generates a random IR tree that represents a PHP program
* `irprint` turns IR tree into a textual representation that can be executed by PHP

### irgen

irgen can generate different kinds of programs, depending on the configuration.

Some examples of what it can do:

* Valid programs that do random stuff
* Valid programs that do a specified action in random contexts
* Invalid programs that will upset PHP parser or KPHP type checker

### irprint

irprint takes IR tree generated by irgen and creates its textual representation
suitable for both PHP and KPHP execution.

Since some bugs can be related to the code formatting, irprint can add
some randomization into the output, making the formatting unexpected and inconsistent.
